Installation
Step 1: Install via Composer
Run the following command to install the package via Composer:

bash
Copy
Edit
composer require dilbrinazad/laravel-multi-lang
This will add the package to your composer.json file and install it into your Laravel application.

Configuration
After installing the package, you need to publish the package configuration file.

Step 2: Publish Configuration File
Publish the packageâ€™s configuration file using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DilbrinAzad\LaravelMultiLang\Src\Providers\LaravelMultiLangServiceProvider" --tag="config"
This will create a multilang.php file in your config directory, where you can customize language settings.

Usage
Publish Migrations and Seeders
Publish the migrations and seeders to set up the necessary database structure for the multi-language feature.

Run the following command to publish the migrations:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DilbrinAzad\LaravelMultiLang\Src\Providers\LaravelMultiLangServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
Once the migrations are published, run the migration command to create the necessary tables in your database:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan migrate
Next, publish the seeders for language:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DilbrinAzad\LaravelMultiLang\Src\Providers\LaravelMultiLangServiceProvider" --tag="seeders"
Run the seeder to populate default languages:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan db:seed --class=LanguageSeeder
Add Multi-language Fields
Once the migrations are set up, you can use the multi-language fields in your models and views. This will allow you to store data for multiple languages.

Example:

In your migration file:
php
Copy
Edit
Schema::create('languages', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('locale');
    $table->timestamps();
});
In your model:
php
Copy
Edit
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Language extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['locale'];
}
Use Translations in Views
You can now use translations in your views.

blade
Copy
Edit
@lang('messages.welcome')
This will automatically display the translation for the current language.

Components
This package includes several view components that help you manage multi-language content more efficiently.

Multi-Language Input Field
You can use the provided multi-language input component to handle translations for different languages.

Example Usage in a Blade View:

blade
Copy
Edit
<x-multilang-input label="Welcome Message" name="welcome_message" :other-languages="$languages" />
This will render an input field for each language, allowing you to input translations.

Seeding Languages
If you need to add languages to your system, use the provided seeder class. By default, languages are seeded from the config/languages.php file.

Example:

php
Copy
Edit
// Add to config/languages.php
return [
    'languages' => [
        ['locale' => 'en', 'title' => 'English'],
        ['locale' => 'es', 'title' => 'Spanish'],
        // Add more languages
    ]
];
Then, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan db:seed --class=LanguageSeeder
